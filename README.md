# Stellar Flares Detection From Photometric Data Using Hidden Markov Models

This repo contains our work, shown in ---, on how to use a Gaussian Process and a hidden Markov model (HMM) to conduct flare detection. Our model simultaneously conducts detrending and flare detection. We use `Celerite`, a Gaussian Process adopted from Python package [exoplanet-celerite2](https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/celerite2)
